### Geometric Neural Operators (GNPs) 

Geometric Neural Operators (GNPs) allow for data-driven deep learning of
features from point-cloud representations and other datasets for tasks
involving geometry.   This includes training protocols and learned operators
for estimating local curvatures, evaluating geometric differential operators,
solvers for PDEs on manifolds, mean-curvature shape flows, and other tasks.
The package provides practical neural network architectures and factorizations
for training to accounting for geometric contributions and features.  The
package also has a modular design allowing for use of GNPs within other
data-processing pipelines.  Pretrained models are also provided for estimating
curvatures, Laplace-Beltrami operators, components for PDE solvers, and other
geometric tasks.

**Robust Estimators:** Our pre-trained GNP models and training methods also allow for 
coping with noise and other artifacts that arise when processing point-clouds in practice.
This allows for robust estimates of the curvature and other geometric properties even when 
point-clouds have artifacts, such as outliers as shown below.

**Examples:** We provide practical demonstrations for how GNPs can be used in practice.  This includes examples (i) to estimate geometric properties, such as the metric and curvatures of
surfaces, (ii) to approximate solutions of geometric partial differential
equations (PDEs) on manifolds, and (iii) to perform curvature-driven flows of
shapes. These results show a few ways GNPs can be used for incorporating the
roles of geometry into machine learning processing pipelines and solvers.

__Quick Start__


```bash
git clone git@github.com:atzberg/geo_neural_op.git
conda create -n gnp
conda activate gnp
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You may also need to first install `pip`,
```bash
conda install pip 
```

For use of the package see the [examples folder](https://github.com/atzberg/geo_neural_op/tree/main/examples).  
More information on the structure of the package also can be found on the
[documentation pages](https://web.math.ucsb.edu/~atzberg/geo_neural_op_docs/html/index.html).

__Packages__ 

The pip install should automatically handle most of the dependencies.  If there are
issues, please be sure to install [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) package version >= 2.0.0.
The full set of dependencies can be found in the [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt).
You may want to first install pytorch package manually to configure it for your specific
GPU system and platform.
